# ELot
 Welcome to the ELot ReadMe! ELot is a simulated market storefront inspired by Ebay and Gamestop.

 This caused an idea to where what if you had a store that had news from the users and products from the users as well, only being a middleman company?

 This shows the idea, with Products, both Traditional and Electronic, articles on these topics, a Transaction and Cart system, and finally a Review System for purchased products.
